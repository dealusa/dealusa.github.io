I've created a fully responsive, high-converting affiliate deal landing page in a single HTML file for your site (`dealusa.github.io`).

You can simply:

1. Open your `index.html` on GitHub
2. Paste the entire code from the canvas
3. Save and publish

It already includes:

* HTML5 + Tailwind CSS
* Animated 3D Coverflow Slider (Swiper.js with full CDN)
* Autoplay + Pagination Dots
* Clean professional header (USA audience optimized)
* High-converting deal cards with discount badges & hover CTA
* Affiliate disclosure footer
* Mobile + desktop responsive design

If you want, I can next:

* Add real Amazon affiliate links
* Auto-fetch deals dynamically
* Add countdown timers (for higher conversions)
* Add email capture popup for affiliate marketing growth
